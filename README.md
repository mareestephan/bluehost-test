A. It took me approx 18hrs to complete. I would have liked to spend more time on it but had to focus on freelance commitments. My time went towards laying out all the HTML elements and then starting to style them. I created a JSON file with data to populate the page - class overview, accordion, instructor overview, and the snapshot cards. I would have liked to add the instructor images class video to the JSON as well.

B. My responsiveness should be better when the browser is being dragged between different widths. I didnâ€™t spend enough time on my video player which has some styling issues. I would have liked to cleanup my SCSS file a bit more. I think there are some repeats which can be removed in the media queries and would also have like to create more components and not have them the full body of the page in one component.

C. I was quite surprised at my lack of naming conventions/structure for CSS selectors. This test highlighted that while freelancing I adopted bad habits to save time, but in return will make it not as easy to share or re-use certain sections.
